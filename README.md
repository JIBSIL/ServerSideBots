# ReallyFakePlayers
This is a Minecraft server plugin under Spigot environment to simulate players. I personally use it to test my own plugins.
The fake players don't trigger the AsyncPlayerPreLoginEvent and PlayerLoginEvent (and maybe others) which allows to have virtual test accounts on servers that don't accept cracked versions.
I created this fork to update the plugin for Minecraft 1.18.2. The original plugin works in 1.17.
